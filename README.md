# Text-mining
Extracting required word/string from a set of comment 

In my current company we were facing in coaliting the comments thta we have received from our field team.
Our Field team use to share their comments in terms of growth/decline for a specific market. 
There comments are totally subjective , with out any set/ standaridize method, as it would be difficlut to restrict them as well :)...

Now at our end it would be totally manual process to extract the meaningful info from those set of comments...

Here i saw the importance of Text Mining and i have try to implemet it in my process and works awesome...
Now with in couple of hours i am able to identify territory wise which are the frequesnt comments that i jhave received for growth and decline...

Attaching one sample code( not original) found on one of the website, which   i found  very useful for my live projects
